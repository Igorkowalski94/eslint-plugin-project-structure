# project-structure-independent-modules

A key principle of a healthy project is to prevent the creation of a massive dependency tree,<br>
where removing or editing one feature triggers a chain reaction that impacts the entire project.<br>
Create independent modules to keep your project scalable and easy to maintain.<br>
Get rid of dependencies between modules and create truly independent functionalities.<br>

#### Features:

‚úÖ Creating independent modules in which you control what can be imported (e.g. types, functions, components of one functionality cannot be imported into another functionality).<br>
‚úÖ Disabling external imports (node_modules) for a given module (Option to add exceptions). <br>
‚úÖ Non-relative/relative imports support. <br>
‚úÖ Support for imports without extension. <br>
‚úÖ Reusable import patterns. <br>
‚úÖ Support for path aliases. The plugin will automatically detect your tsconfig.json and use your settings. There is also an option to enter them manually.<br>
‚úÖ An option to create a separate configuration file with TypeScript support.<br>

## Installation

```bsh
yarn add -D eslint-plugin-independent-modules
```

```bsh
npm i --dev eslint-plugin-independent-modules
```

## Getting started

### Step 1

Add the following lines to **`eslint.config.mjs`**.

> [!NOTE]  
>  The examples in the documentation refer to ESLint's new config system. If you're interested in examples for the old ESLint config, you can find them in the [**playground**](https://github.com/Igorkowalski94/eslint-plugin-project-structure-playground) for eslint-plugin-project-structure rules.

```mjs
// @ts-check

import eslint from "@eslint/js";
import tseslint from "typescript-eslint";
import { projectStructurePlugin } from "eslint-plugin-project-structure";
import { independentModulesConfig } from "./independentModules.mjs";

export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [...tseslint.configs.recommended],
  files: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "**/*.js", "**/*.jsx"],
  plugins: {
    "project-structure": projectStructurePlugin,
  },
  rules: {
    ...eslint.configs.recommended.rules,

    // If you have many rules in a separate file.
    "project-structure/independent-modules": [
      "error",
      independentModulesConfig,
    ],
    // If you have only a few rules.
    "project-structure/independent-modules": [
      "error",
      {
        // Config
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

### Step 2

Create a **`independentModules.mjs`** in the root of your project.<br>

> [!NOTE]  
>  **`independentModules.json`** and **`independentModules.yaml`** are also supported. See an example in the [**playground**](https://github.com/Igorkowalski94/eslint-plugin-project-structure-playground) for eslint-plugin-project-structure rules.

## API:

### **`tsconfigPath`**: `<string | undefined>` <a id="tsconfig-path"></a>

The path to your `tsconfig.json`.<br>
If your `tsconfig` is located in the root of your project, the plugin will automatically detect it.<br>
If your `tsconfig` is located elsewhere, you can specify its location here.

```jsonc
{ "tsconfigPath": "./tsconfig.json" }
```

### **`pathAliases`**: `<{ baseUrl: string; paths: Record<string, string[]>; } | undefined>` <a id="path-aliases"></a>

The plugin automatically takes `baseUrl` and `paths` from your `tsconfig.json`.<br>
However, if you are using another tool for path aliases, such as `Webpack` or `Babel`, you can configure the appropriate path aliases here.

```ts
// "src/components/Component.tsx"
import { Component } from "@components/Component";
```

```jsonc
{
  "pathAliases": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@components/*": ["src/components/*"],
    },
  },
}
```

### **`extensions`**: `<string[] | undefined>` <a id="extensions"></a>

If you use shortened imports without a file extension, the plugin will automatically assign the correct extension from the list of available extensions.

```ts
// "helpers/myHelper.ts"
import { myHelper } from "helpers/myHelper"; // The plugin will recognize the file as a .ts file and consider this when validating the glob pattern.
```

Available extensions: **`".js"`**, **`".jsx"`**, **`".mjs"`**, **`".cjs"`** **`".d.ts"`**, **`".ts"`**, **`".tsx"`**, **`".vue"`**, **`".svelte"`**, **`".json"`**, **`".jsonc"`**, **`".yml"`**, **`".yaml"`**, **`".svg"`**, **`".png"`**, **`".jpg"`**, **`".ico"`**, **`".css"`**, **`".sass"`**, **`".scss"`**, **`".less"`**, **`".html"`**,

If the extension you are using is not on the list, you can extend it.

```jsonc
{ "extensions": [".yourFancyExtension"] }
```

### **`modules`**: `<Module[]>` <a id="modules"></a>

A place where you can add your modules.<br>

After creation, each module will not be able to import anything except external imports (these are allowed by default, can also be disabled).

> [!WARNING]
> The order of modules matters! Module patterns are checked in order from top to bottom.

```jsonc
{
  "modules": [
    {
      "name": "Module 1",
      "pattern": "*",
      "allowImportsFrom": [],
    },
    // Module 2 with "features/**" will not be taken into account because Module 1 with "*" meets the condition.
    {
      "name": "Module 2",
      "pattern": "features/**",
      "allowImportsFrom": [],
    },
  ],
}
```

```jsonc
{
  "modules": [
    // Module 2 with "features/**" will be taken into account because Module 1 with "*" is below Module 2.
    {
      "name": "Module 2",
      "pattern": "features/**",
      "allowImportsFrom": [],
    },
    {
      "name": "Module 1",
      "pattern": "*",
      "allowImportsFrom": [],
    },
  ],
}
```

```jsonc
{
  "modules": [
    {
      "name": "Module 1",
      "pattern": ["*", "!features/**"],
      "allowImportsFrom": [],
    },
    // Module 2 with "features/**" will be taken into account because Module 1 with ["*", "!features/**"] ignores "features/**" pattern.
    {
      "name": "Module 2",
      "pattern": "features/**",
      "allowImportsFrom": [],
    },
  ],
}
```

### **`name`**: `<string>` <a id="name"></a>

The name of your module.

```jsonc
{ "modules": [{ "name": "features" }] }
```

### **`pattern`**: `<string | string[]>` <a id="pattern"></a>

Your module's pattern.<br>

You can use all **[micromatch.every](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch?tab=readme-ov-file#every)** functionalities.

```jsonc
{
  "modules": [
    { "pattern": "features/**" },
    // Everything from the helpers folder except the index.ts and .js files.
    { "pattern": ["helpers/**", "!(**/index.ts)", "!(**/*.js)"] },
  ],
}
```

### **`allowImportsFrom`**: `<(string | string[])[]>` <a id="allow-imports-from"></a>

The place where you specify what can be imported into your module.<br>

You can use all **[micromatch.every](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch?tab=readme-ov-file#every)** functionalities.<br>

If at least **one** pattern in **`allowImportsFrom`** meets the condition, the import is considered allowed.<br>

> [!WARNING]
> The order of patterns matters! They are checked from top to bottom.

```jsonc
{
  "modules": [
    {
      "allowImportsFrom": [
        // All files from the first directory of the helpers folder.
        "helpers/*",

        // All files from the types folder. All directories/nestings.
        "types/**",

        // All nested files in hooks folder except *.types.ts
        ["hooks/**", "!hooks/**/*.types.ts"],

        // All nested files in the components folder except files in the helpers folders.
        ["components/**", "!components/**/helpers/**"],

        // All nested .js files in the helpers folder except index.js
        ["helpers/**/*.js", "!helpers/**/index.js"],
      ],
    },
    {
      "allowImportsFrom": [
        // All nested .js files in the helpers folder
        "helpers/**/*.js",

        // It will not be taken into account because "helpers/**/*.js" met the condition.
        // Not index.js files in the helpers folder.
        "!helpers/**/index.js",
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

### **`errorMessage`**: `<string | undefined>` <a id="error-message"></a>

Here, you can set your custom error for a given module.

```jsonc
{ "modules": [{ "errorMessage": "My custom module error." }] }
```

### **`allowExternalImports`**: `<boolean | undefined>` <a id="allow-external-imports"></a>

Here you can enable/disable the ability to import external imports (node_modules) in a given module.<br>

The default value is true.

```jsonc
{
  "modules": [
    {
      "allowExternalImports": false,
      //You can specify exceptions via allowImportsFrom.
      "allowImportsFrom": ["react"],
    },
  ],
}
```

### **`reusableImportPatterns`**: `Record<string, (string | string[])[]>` <a id="reusable-import-patterns"></a>

To avoid repetitions, you can create reusable import patterns. <br>
By writing **`"{yourKey}"`** you refer to a particular key in the **`reusableImportPatterns`** object,<br>
you can use this reference in **`reusableImportPatterns`** and in [**`"allowImportsFrom"`**](#allow-imports-from).<br>

The library will automatically inform you about all usage errors such as: Infinite recursion, too many array nests. e.t.c.

```jsonc
{
  "reusableImportPatterns": {
    "pattern1": ["pattern1_a"],
    "pattern2": ["pattern2_a", "pattern2_b"],
    "pattern3": ["pattern3_a", "pattern3_b", ["pattern3_c", "pattern3_d"]],

    "pattern4": ["pattern4_a", "{pattern1}"],
    //          ["pattern4_a", "pattern1_a"]

    "pattern5": ["pattern5_a", ["{pattern1}"]],
    //          ["pattern5_a", ["pattern1_a"]]

    "pattern6": ["pattern6_a", "**/{pattern1}/**"],
    //          ["pattern6_a", "**/pattern1_a/**"]

    "pattern7": ["pattern7_a", "{pattern2}"],
    //          ["pattern7_a", "pattern2_a", "pattern2_b"]

    "pattern8": ["pattern8_a", ["{pattern2}"]],
    //          ["pattern8_a", ["pattern2_a", "pattern2_b"]]

    "pattern9": ["pattern9_a", "{pattern3}"],
    //          ["pattern9_a", "pattern3_a", "pattern3_b", ["pattern3_c", "pattern3_d"]]
  },
  "modules": [
    {
      "name": "Some Module",
      "pattern": "*",
      "allowImportsFrom": ["{pattern1}/*.ts", "{pattern9}"],
      //                  ["pattern1_a/*.ts", "pattern9_a", "pattern3_a", "pattern3_b", ["pattern3_c", "pattern3_d"]]
    },
  ],
}
```

### **`{family}`** <a id="family"></a>

**`{family}`** reference finds the common part between the import and the current file. <br>
By default, at least **two** common parts are required, [`baseUrl`](#path-aliases) is not taken into account.<br>
This will make your rule work **recursively**/apply to all nestings.<br>
You can change the number of parts required, **`{family_1}`** at least one, **`{family_3}`** at least three common part etc.<br>

```
Example 1
Current file    = "features/Feature1/Feature1.tsx"
Import          = "features/Feature1/Feature1.types.ts"
{family}        = "features/Feature1"

Example 2
Current file    = "features/Feature1/Feature1.tsx"
Import          = "features/Feature1/Feature1.types.ts"
{family_3}      = "NO_FAMILY"

Example 3
Current file    = "features/Feature1/Child1/Child1.tsx"
Import          = "features/Feature1/Child1/hooks/useComplexHook/useComplexHook.ts"
{family}        = "features/Feature1/Child1"


Example 4
Current file    = "features/Feature1/Child1/hooks/useComplexHook1/useComplexHook1.ts"
import          = "features/Feature1/Child1/hooks/useComplexHook2/useComplexHook2.ts"
{family}        = "features/Feature1/Child1/hooks"

Example 5
Current file    = "features/Feature1/Feature1.tsx"
Import          = "features/Feature2/Feature2.types.ts"
{family}        = "NO_FAMILY"

Example 6
Current file    = "features/Feature1/Feature1.tsx"
Import          = "features/Feature2/Feature2.types.ts"
{family_1}      = "features"
```

### **`{dirname}`** <a id="dirname"></a>

Reference to the directory of the file you are currently in.

By default, **`{dirname}`** will refer to the nearest directory of the given file you are in.
You can determine the directory lvl by the following notation **`{dirname_2}`**, **`{dirname_3}`** and so on.

```
Example 1
Current file    = "features/Feature1/Feature1.tsx"
{dirname}       = "features/Feature1"

Example 2
Current file    = "features/Feature1/Child1/Child1.tsx"
{dirname}       = "features/Feature1/Child1"

Example 3
Current file    = "features/Feature1/Feature1.tsx"
{dirname_2}     = "features"

Example 4
Current file    = "features/Feature1/Child1/hooks/useComplexHook1/useComplexHook1.ts"
{dirname_5}     = "features"
```

### **`debugMode`**: `<boolean | undefined>` <a id="debug-mode"></a>

Debug mode showing the current [**`allowImportsFrom`**](#allow-imports-from), [**`{family}`**](#family), and [**`{dirname}`**](#dirname) for a given import.<br>
The default value is `false`.

```jsonc
{ "debugMode": true }
```
